0x1D. C - Binary trees
In the world of computer science and data structures, binary trees stand as fundamental and versatile entities. They play a pivotal role in storing and managing data efficiently. 

At its core, a binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, each with a maximum of two child nodes: a left child and a right child. The top node, known as the root, serves as the entry point. Each child node itself may have further child nodes, forming a branching structure. This arrangement allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of data.

While both binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs) share the same hierarchical structure, BSTs have an additional property. In a BST, for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node’s value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node’s value. This inherent ordering property enables faster search operations compared to regular binary trees.
